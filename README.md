# jab-react-tree [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gabchang/jab-react-tree.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/gabchang/jab-react-tree)
React tree component

This is a fork of [react-ui-tree](https://pqx.github.io/react-ui-tree) by [Wang Zuo](https://github.com/pqx).
This project was initially developed for a webpage builder. It maintains an internal tree structure within the component through [js-tree](https://github.com/wangzuo/js-tree).

THIS PROJECT HAS MOVED TO @b-flower org : see [bdn-react-tree](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@b-flower/bdn-react-tree)
